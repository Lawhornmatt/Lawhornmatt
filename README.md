### Who I am:

I am a junior full-stack developer with a bachelors in Geology from UT at El Paso. I've been a project manager and an assistant production manager at a plant and for nearly a decade I was in the service industry. And now I take all the skills and lessons from those experiences, the support of some amazing folks I met along the way, and I get to make cutting-edge web solutions.

### Let's collaborate:

I have made most of my projects with ES6+ JavaScript. I am always excited to work with a MERN stack. I think Next.js is fascinating. I am in love with the UI/UX of Apollo Client and GraphQL. Currently playing around with Electron.js

As you may have guessed, I think rocks are pretty rad. Particularly: mapping with GIS, paleontology, and economic geology. 

If you or your company work with anything even tangentially related to the above, I will probably find it interesting and would like to hear from you. Go to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-lawhorn/">my LinkedIn</a> and send me a message!
