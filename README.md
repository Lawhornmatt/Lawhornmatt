### Who I am:

I am a junior full-stack developer, but I haven't always been. Two years ago I got my B.S. in Geology at UT El Paso. I've been a project manager and an assistant production manager at a plant. And for nearly a decade I was in the service industry. And now I take all the skills and lessons from those experiences, the support of the folks I met along the way, add a smidge of hacking away at a keyboard, and I get to make cutting edge web apps-- how cool is that?

### Should you contact me:

I've heard of ES6+ JavaScript. Seen a MERN stack a couple of times. I think Next.js is fascinating. I am in love with the UI/UX of Apollo Client and GraphQL. Currently playing around with Electron.js

As you may have guessed, I think rocks are pretty rad. Particularly: mapping with GIS, paleontology, and economic geology. Exploring how web developement can cross over into these areas is an interest of mine.

If you read the above and think, "this is the kind of web development geo-nerd I am looking to recruit on my team" then you should definitely go to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-lawhorn/">my LinkedIn</a> and send me a message!
